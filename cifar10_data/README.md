# CIFAR-10 Data Information

CIFAR-10 data can be downloaded from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-binary.tar.gz
and saved to this directory and extracted for testing. After extraction, there should
be a `stf4j-test-models/cifar10_data/cifar-10-batches-bin` directory containing files such
as `test-batch.bin`.
